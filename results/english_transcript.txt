 Hi, I'm here because I injured my middle finger a few months ago and it hasn't fully recovered. I had a dip cut on the inner side of the finger right along the palm side. It happened with a sharp object and I needed six stitches. At the hospital they told me the tendon wasn't completely cut, which was a relief. But even after the wound healed I can't extend the finger properly. It bends fine, I can make a fest, but opening it's very limited. There is no intense pain now, just stiffness and tightness. It feels like something is stuck when I try to straighten it. Sometimes it drops a little if I use my hand too much. This car looks fine on the surface, but something underneath feels restricted. I was never referred to a physio, so I didn't do any guided rehab. I tried moving it gently at home, but nothing seemed to help. It's been around six months now and the mobility hasn't really improved. I have to use my other hand to help extend it. Even then it doesn't go fully straight and feels uncomfortable. I noticed it is partially when I type or hold objects. My grip strength is also weaker than before. I feel things like holding a mug or brushing my hair, feel awkward. Sometimes I accidentally drop things because of the weakness. I've tried warm water, massaging the area and stretching. It helps slightly in the movement, but not long-term. I think skull tissue may have built up and is limiting movement. I didn't have any imaging done after these features. I'm worried now that I should have done more earlier. The finger just stayed bent like it's a stuck halfway. It makes pasts like getting dressed or buttoning shirts harder. Even putting on gloves is annoying. I haven't done any strain or resistance training for the hand. Honestly, I'm afraid of making it worse. It doesn't hurt constantly, but the limited range is frustrating. I use my hands all the time and this really impacts their life. I once understand what's going on inside, tendons, joys, or scar. And I'm hoping we can work on restoring movement through physio. If I need this plant or certain exercises, I'm happy to do that. I just don't want this to become permanent. It feels like I lost confidence in using that hand. Even when I cook or cling, I'm overly cautious now. This wasn't something I expected from a simple cut. I didn't think one finger would affect so much. I'm hoping it's not too late to fix this. If you think I need imaging or a hand specialist, I'm open to it. But I'd really like to try therapy, physiotherapy, and exercises first. I'm ready to work on it consistently. I just want to be able to open and use my hand normally again.
