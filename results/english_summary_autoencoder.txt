 Hi, I'm here because I injured my middle finger a few months ago and it hasn't fully recovered It happened with a sharp object and I needed six stitches At the hospital they told me the tendon wasn't completely cut, which was a relief There is no intense pain now, just stiffness and tightness It's been around six months now and the mobility hasn't really improved I feel things like holding a mug or brushing my hair, feel awkward I've tried warm water, massaging the area and stretching I'm worried now that I should have done more earlier I use my hands all the time and this really impacts their life But I'd really like to try therapy, physiotherapy, and exercises first
